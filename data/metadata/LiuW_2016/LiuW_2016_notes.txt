LiuW 2016

dataset of 110 Mongolians, healthy and 
a subsection of Agrarians.

metadata status: many principal fields missing (gender, age), present fe usefull information 
    mainly for the fact that some of them are Agrarians, 

    and so we have agrarians from Africa (dataset: Rampelli), Fiji (Brito), South-America (Obregon-Tito) and Asia (this one)



missing things:  the annotation of Agrarians has been taken by a NCBI file recording which of them
come from Ulan Bator and TUW province (and so they are Urban). The others have been inserted as AGRARIANS

but some of thm might come from another city which was not indicated in the file but was indicated on the paper
Therefore some of the Agrarians might not be effectively agrarians.
