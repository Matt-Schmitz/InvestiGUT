Xie H 2016 is a study about 250 english twin women:

they are healty, no antibiotics, no lactating and no pregnant

peculiarities: all women, all twins, healthy.

BODYSITE = GUT

.

This is usefull information, HOWEVER:

IT IS MISSING STILL the mst intersting information: which sample is twin of which.

In case, it would be ideal to add this on dedicated column,
somegthing like in Heintz-Buschart is indicated in the family column 
the relative among samples.

metadata status: acceptable

missing things: they are something like 125 twin couples and we don't know 
who'is twin to who.
