GUT

Tanzania & Italy 

ImportNT BECAUSE HADZAN ARE AGRARIANS  (the ptger agrarinas datasets of this collection are: Obregon Tito (south America) and Brito (Fiji))

So this dataset is importat because we cover 3 continents of Agrarians.


Metadatata status: acceptable
missing things: No information about disease and especially antibiotics,
