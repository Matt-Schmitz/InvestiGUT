Karlsson FH 2013

145 subjects (and samples) dataset about Type-2 diabetes 
with large metadata. 

COUNTRY: Sweden
bodysite: GUT

all women, quite old. No abx.

metadata status: good
missing things:  Here and in others the main problem will be 
  		to assess as much as possible the current state of the present measurements:

 		e.g.: I tried briefly to uniform the measurements (all should be either mmol/ml or mg/dl)
                meaning that the same measure (e.g. C-peptide should be present in all the dataset (when available))
                in just one fo the standard measure units: tthere can be howver errors, like 

		ldl and hdl in mg/dl and cholesterol in mmol/l.
