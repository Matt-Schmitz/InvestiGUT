Vincent C 2016

dataset of 98 subjects and 229 samples

MULTIPLE TP study (partially):

not regular: few subjects have more than 10 samples

many have just one samples

however, for sake of precision, the day-gap of multiple tps 
from the tp 0 is taken and recorded.

BODYSITE = GUT
COUNTRY: CANADA (Montreal)
Disease : CDI (Clostridium difficle infection: basically this infection is frequently taken in
hospitals and they wanted to investigate this fact: only few subject have contracted CDI)


metadata status: not so bad

missing things: A LOT::

1)	information about CDI infected samples have been taken by me in Fig 1 of the paper and are unprecise
2)	same for antibiotics: it is clearly written that basically all the subjects have been subjected to ABX

	however: only for the CDI infected was possible to detect this information.
   	it WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE INFO ABOUT ABX EVEN FOR THE OTHERS.

	THE ABX I've recorded are someway unprecise and probably some ABX is missing by my List.


Last peculiarity: this dataset is about very old people. (VERY OLD PEOPLE)
